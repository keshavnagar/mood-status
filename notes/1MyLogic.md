so for mood status mini project i just play with onclic and single state , in which i just initialize the state with "" but when i click on button happy than onclick of happy button set the positive message in setMessage method 
and when i click on sad button than onclick set the supportive message to setMessage method
and so on 

but we also do with three states , isHappy, isSad and isNeutreal

so let me try this 

so i created than in which i created three states and everytime i just click on button it toggle the true false and than it show the tag texts

but here is the there are three states that's why we show the three paragraphs
